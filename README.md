Dynamic To-Do List with Local Storage
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple and interactive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to:

Add tasks

Remove tasks

Automatically save tasks in Local Storage, so the list remains available after refreshing or reopening the browser.

Features
Add New Tasks: Users can type a task and add it easily.

Remove Tasks: Each task includes a remove button to delete it.

Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser using Local Storage, ensuring they are not lost after a page reload or browser restart.

How It Works
Task Input & Adding

Users enter a task in the input field and click the Add Task button or press Enter.

Task Removal

Each task has a remove button. Clicking it deletes the task from both the screen and Local Storage.

Local Storage

All tasks are saved in the browser automatically. When the page is loaded again, the saved tasks are displayed.

Project Structure
index.html – Contains the basic structure of the app

styles.css – Handles styling for a clean and responsive design

script.js – Contains all the logic for adding, removing, and saving tasks in Local Storage

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ketemaderesa/dynamic-to-do-list-js.git
Open the index.html file in your browser.

Start adding and removing tasks. Refresh the page to see your tasks persist.
